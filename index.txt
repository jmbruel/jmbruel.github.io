= title

You are hired by your client ({client}) to develop a little software, called 
*CURLING* (_**C**heck if my *URL* **LIN**ks are **G**ood_).

== Goals and context

{client} write lots of reports and tutorials which include references to web documents
(URLs). He has no time to check them all the time. He is hirin your group to develop
a dedicated tool to do that for him. 

== Basic needs

The minimal need is to provide a tool that would ask {client} a file and then provides him with a 
list of buggy URLs (or a big smile of all are OK). {client} is aware of software good practices
and also ask you to provide a MVC architecture for the tool.

Of course its ideal application would maintain a list of documents, with information such as: last time
they were checked, their type (e.g., +.html+, +.txt+, +.docx.+), their absolute name (e.g., +/Users/JohnDoe/docs/test.txt+).

== Optional needs

We can imagine that instead of providing a file name, {client} provides a complete directory.
We can also imagine that {client} can select a file, or a type of file in the list of already
checked documents to redo the check again, etc.

== Test cases

Here is an example of file {client} would like to check: link:definition.txt[].
